# Practical-Machine-Learning-QMUL
## Projects from the 3-week  2019-summer course on Practical Machine Learning in Queen's Mary University of London

Week 1 includes some scripts on normal, poisson and exponential distributions with the use of simple python libraries.

Week 2 is an introduction in Linear Regression and some methods used in Machine Learning.

Week 3 includes the Chronis_Sakos_KaggleHiggs2.py script in order to to solve a 2 output target classification problem based on input data from the 
H->tau+tau- Kaggle data set. We explore the effects of different values for learning rate, dropout keep probability and the weight regularization parameter. We run both the small and the complete datasets in order to compare them.

In order to run Week's 3 script you need to download "Kaggle H20190805" zip file and run Chronis_Sakos_KaggleHiggs2.py script.
